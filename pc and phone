Okay, here's an enhanced prompt for Bolt.new, incorporating the overall dashboard requirements (including Swap, Send, and Receive functionalities) and adhering to the specified answer format for each relevant API interaction:
Prompt for Bolt.new:
> Generate the React component(s) for the user dashboard page and the associated Send and Receive pages. The dashboard should aim for a Binance-style UI with the following structure and features, utilizing the specified backend API endpoints and handling data as described in the answer format below.
> I. Main Dashboard Page (/dashboard)
> Purpose: Display the user's virtual wallet balances, action buttons for Swap, Send, and Receive, investment status, and other user information.
> HTTP Method: GET
> Endpoint URL: /api/dashboard
> Authentication: JWT token in the Authorization header.
> Request Data: None.
> Response Data (Success - JSON - HTTP Status 200):
{
  "user": {
    "email": "string (user's email address)",
    "walletId": "string (user's unique wallet identifier - UUIDv4)",
    "balance": {
      "USD": "float (user's USD balance)",
      "BTC": "float (user's Bitcoin balance)",
      "ETH": "float (user's Ethereum balance)"
      // Add other currencies as needed

  },

    "activePlans": [
      {
        "planId": "string (ID of the investment plan)",
        "name": "string (name of the investment plan)",
        "amountInvested": "float (amount invested in this plan)",

}
> Error Handling:
 * 401 Unauthorized: Invalid or missing JWT token in the Authorization header.
 * 403 Forbidden: Access denied, typically because the user's accessStatus is not "granted" (e.g., the access fee hasn't been paid).
 * 404 Not Found: User not found based on the provided token (this is less likely if the token is valid).
 * 500 Internal Server Error: An unexpected error occurred on the server while processing the request.
The frontend should:
 * Check the HTTP status code of the response.
 * If successful (200), parse the JSON response to display the user's dashboard information.
 * If an error occurs (401, 403, 500), display an appropriate error message to the user and potentially guide them on how to resolve the issue (e.g., log in again, pay the access fee, contact support).
Data Types:
 * email: string
 * walletId: string (UUIDv4)
 * balance: object with currency codes (e.g., "USD", "BTC", "ETH") as keys and their corresponding float values.
 * kycStatus: string ("pending", "approved", "rejected", "NOT_SUBMITTED")
 * accessStatus: string ("pending", "granted")
 * investmentStatus: object containing:
   * activePlans: array of objects, each representing an active investment plan.
   * availablePlans: array of objects, each representing an available investment plan.
 * proPlusStatus: string ("active" or "inactive")

> Sequential Calls: On successful login, this endpoint is called to fetch initial dashboard data.

>  * On submitting the send form, call /api/wallets/transfer (POST).
> UI Components:
>  * Fetch user balances (if using /api/wallets/balances, format response as: {"BTC": "balance", "ETH": "balance", ...}). Otherwise, parse from the /api/dashboard response.

> Error Handling: Handle errors if the currency is invalid or if there's a server error. Display appropriate messages.
> Data Types:
>  * currency: string
>  * address: string
>  * memo: string
>  * qrCode: string
> Sequential Calls:
>  * On loading the /receive page, display a list of supported cryptocurrencies (e.g., BTC, ETH, USDT...).

>  * Allow the user to select a currency.
>  * Display the corresponding simulated deposit address.
>  * Button to copy the address to the clipboard.
>  * Display the currency name and the QR code (if provided).
> Ensure all components have a clean and intuitive user interface consistent with the overall Binance-style application design.

=====================
remember to add a prompt to add send and receive buttons on the Dashboard 

"Present two interactive elements on the Dashboard, ideally with accompanying icons, under the wallet ballance field:

* [Send Icon] **Send:** Text label indicating the action of transferring cryptocurrency to another user.
* [Receive Icon] **Receive:** Text label indicating the action of viewing deposit addresses to receive cryptocurrency.
