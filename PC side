5. ================/exchange – Fake Trading System (Simulated UX)

Top Navigation: Search Bar with magnifying icon (top center)
Placeholder: “Search coins (e.g., BTC, ETH, DOGE)”
Filters through a list of 50+ static pairs in real-time

Add a simulated live chart component to my Crypto Access Pro app that displays real-time crypto prices (like BTC/ETH) but in a simulated format. Use CoinGecko’s public API to fetch the current market price every 5–10 seconds. Generate a fake dataset of chart points that fluctuates slightly around the current price using small random offsets. Use Recharts (or ApexCharts if preferred) to display the chart and update it dynamically every few seconds. The chart should simulate activity over the last 30–60 minutes, with new data points added and old ones removed continuously. Make the component mobile-responsive and visually 
consistent with the Binance-style UI of the app. No actual trading or WebSocket integration is required — just real price + simulated chart behavior.

Trading Pairs List:
Show at least 50 fake trading pairs (expandable list with scrolling):
Examples (First 20):

Technical Notes:

Styling: TailwindCSS 
API: Axios(JWT handling)
Email verification must be handled
KYC uploads should be stored locally (no cloud)
Static data only — no external APIs or real-time prices
Clean UI with multi-page routing and smooth transitions
Admin has full control — nothing happens without admin manual action
Real wallet addresses must appear clearly where required

UI/UX Instructions:
Replicate Binance app style (dark/light theme. Clean tabs)
Smooth transitions between pages
Clean spacing, intuitive navigation responsive designs

Adaptive Layouts:
The website's layout should adjusts dynamically based on the device's dimensions and resolution.

Fluid Grid System:
Content should be arranged in a grid that adapts to the screen size, preventing elements from overflowing or being cut off.

Responsive Images:
Images should be sized and scaled to fit the available space, ensuring they appear sharp and clear on all devices.

Mobile-First Approach:
The design should prioritizes mobile usability, meaning the website's structure should first be developed for mobile screens and then adapted for larger screens

Show pop-up messages on actions (e.g., “Email verified,” “KYC Submitted,” etc.)

 I only need the frontend built to connect to an existing node.js backend. The backend for this app is fully completed already, including user auth, KYC, wallet, investments, admin controls, and all secured API endpoints for all core features, including:

•	User registration and login with email verification
•	Access fee payment screen ($99.90 in crypto to admin wallet)
•	Pro+ subscription upgrade ($299.99 crypto to admin wallet)
•	Virtual wallet with real/virtual balances and activity
•	Simulated crypto investment system with ROI
•	Simulated crypto trading/exchange panel
•	User-to-user P2P trading (admin-controlled)
•	KYC system (ID + selfie uploads, no cloud storage)
•	Withdrawal request system (Pro+ users only)
•	Multilingual support (language selection on entry + inside app)
•	Admin dashboard (secured route, not part of this frontend scope)

Design the frontend to call my existing backend endpoints using axios. Use dummy data or mocks where needed to simulate the backend flow.

Main app pages (in order):
Splash/welcome page with language selector
Access fee payment screen (shows crypto wallet address)
Email verification flow
Dashboard home (wallet overview, stats)
Investment tab (select amount, show ROI history)
Exchange tab (buy/sell crypto, use virtual funds)
P2P trading tab (offers, admin approval info)
Pro+ upgrade page
KYC submission page (upload ID and selfie locally)
Withdrawal request page (locked until Pro+ and KYC are complete)
Profile/settings (language change, logout)

Make the UI as smooth and visually polished as Binance. Use modern fonts, subtle shadows, smooth tab transitions, animated buttons, and properly spaced layouts. Prioritize mobile-first design.

Backend Notes:
- No real-time market data or exchange APIs.
- Email, KYC, Pro+, and withdrawal logic already built (no need to code backend).
- Wallets are virtual, with full admin control.
- ROI calculated weekly and updated.
- All payments (access and Pro+) are shown to user as crypto addresses only — no payment gateway
 Delivery checklist 
[ ] All real wallet addresses show up correctly
[ ] Signup, email verify, and admin approval flow works
[ ] Payment screen with wallet addresses and bypass works properly
[ ] Admin dashboard protected from public access
[ ] No real crypto functionality — only visual and virtual
[ ] Fully responsive on macOS, windows, Android and iOS browsers
[ ] Admin can control every part of the system
